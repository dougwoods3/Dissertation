ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
\end{center}

I first want to thank my Lord and Savior for the opportunities and gifts I've been given. I want to thank my major advisor, Dr. Todd Palmer, for piquing my interest in transport discretizations during the advanced courses he taught. He found and presented the opportunity to work on this project, brought immense knowledge, and has been encouraging throughout this entire project. Thanks to Dr. Tom Brunner for serving as my mentor during a summer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and giving me an inordinate amount of time and patience. I must thank my parents for being so encouraging, supporting, and loving during my life including. All of my family has been so patient with me -- I too often neglected visiting them despite our relatively close proximity at OSU.
